/**
 * A sponsored company's profile: overview, visa sponsorship, open jobs,

 * the session) — never reachable from a public/student-facing route, which
 * is also why this page can show contacts at all (see migration 0011 /
 * app/routers/contacts.py).
 *
 * No email generation or sending here by design — see the separate Outreach
 * flow (app/coach/(workspace)/outreach) for composing and sending; this page
 * only shows what's already been sent, read-only-ish (reply/follow-up/close/
 * notes actions, same OutreachActivityList component the Outreach dashboard
 * uses — not a second copy of that list logic).
