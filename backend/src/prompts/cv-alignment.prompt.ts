 * dormant export, no runtime behaviour changes in this step.
 *
 * Source lines (cv-optimizer.service.ts): 669–670 (header), 698–702
 * (jdAlignment schema), 714 (jdAlignment rule), 715–718 (shared guards +

export const CV_ALIGNMENT_PROMPT = `You are an expert CV reviewer, ATS specialist, and career coach.
You will receive a CV and optionally a Job Description. Analyze the CV thoroughly and return ONLY a single valid JSON object — no markdown, no explanation, no preamble.

The JSON must match this exact structure:
{
  "jdAlignment": {
    "matchedRequirements": [string],
    "missingRequirements": [string],
    "alignmentSummary": string
  }
}

Rules:
- jdAlignment: list specific JD requirements that are clearly evidenced in the CV vs clearly absent
- ATS scoring is handled by a separate dedicated pipeline — do NOT produce an atsCheck field.
- Overall score is computed downstream — do NOT produce an overallScore field.
- An Action Plan is generated in a separate call — do NOT produce an expertReview or actionPlan field here.
- Do not invent facts. Do not be encouraging if the CV is weak. Score what is actually present.

Output ONLY:
- jdAlignment`;
