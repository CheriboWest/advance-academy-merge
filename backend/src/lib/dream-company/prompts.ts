YOUR TASK:

1. First, write a "Future You" section — paint a vivid picture of who this candidate will become after completing the full roadmap, specifically in the context of the selected roles. Include:
   - personTheyWillBecome: A compelling 2-3 sentence description of the professional they will transform into. Be specific — reference the selected roles, the skills they'll master, and the kind of impact they'll make.
   - achievementSummary: A concise summary of the key achievements and milestones they will have accomplished by the end of the roadmap.

2. Then build exactly 3 phases:
- Phase 1 (0-6 months): Foundation building and quick wins
- Phase 2 (6-18 months): Growth and positioning
- Phase 3 (2-5 years): Career advancement and leadership

For each phase provide:
- phase: the phase number (1, 2, or 3)
- duration: the time range (e.g., "0-6 months")
- goal: one clear overarching goal for this phase
- actions: 4-6 specific, actionable steps (e.g., "Build a portfolio project using React and TypeScript showcasing data visualization" not "improve your skills")
- skills: 3-5 specific skills to develop during this phase
- milestone: one concrete, measurable milestone that proves this phase is complete

RULES:
- Actions must be specific to this candidate's profile and their selected target roles
- Reference their actual skills, gaps, and interests
- Each milestone must be measurable and concrete
- Skills should address identified gaps from the assessment
- The roadmap should clearly map the candidate from their current state to their future version capable of excelling in the selected roles
