"""Self-check for sponsor-register bulk-import reliability.

`python test_sponsor_import_retry.py` — offline.

The real import of 141,904 rows died on `httpx.ReadTimeout` during a later
batch: every request used the 15-second interactive default, and a 500-row
upsert into a six-figure table with a unique index outgrew it. These checks
cover the retry, the idempotent resume, and the property that matters most —
a partial import never withdraws anything.
