"""Regression test for "column outreach_emails.last_contacted_at does not
exist": `python test_outreach_emails_columns.py` (no pytest, no network, no
live database).

Same shape as test_public_company_summary_view.py, for outreach_emails
instead of public_company_summary. outreach_emails is a plain table (not a
view) that predates the migrations directory — see migration 0012's header
comment — so there is no full historical schema to parse out of the
migrations alone, only what they *add*. This test checks that every column
referenced against outreach_emails — every frontend query (reads and
writes, across every file that touches the table, not just the one the
last reported error happened to be in) plus the backend's own send-time
write in app/routers/email.py — is accounted for: either part of the
documented pre-migrations baseline (apps/web/lib/types.ts's OutreachEmail
interface says which those are) or declared by an `add column if not
exists` in some migration. It cannot confirm a migration was actually
applied to any particular live database — no test in this repo can — but
it does mean a query referencing a column no migration ever declared, or a
column silently dropped from what a migration adds, fails here instead of
shipping as a live "does not exist" error.
