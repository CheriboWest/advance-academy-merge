"""Where the rest of the repo sits, as seen from this service.

Several self-checks here assert *agreement* between the FastAPI layer and the
web and migration layers — that a route the API exposes has a client calling it,
that a column the code reads exists in a migration. That makes them the tests
most sensitive to the tree moving, and during the career-hub merge the tree
moves twice: `apps/api` -> `backend-python` (done), and `careerhub/apps/web` ->
the merged Next app (Stage 4, still to come).

Each test used to derive its own root with `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`,
which silently became wrong the moment this directory changed depth — six tests
failing with "file not found" for a file that had simply moved. Defining the
layout in one place means the next move edits this file, not six.

ponytail: three constants, no path-resolution helper. Add one when a caller
needs something these don't already give it.
