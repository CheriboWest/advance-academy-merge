"""Self-check for chunked sponsor-register finalization (migration 0010).

`python test_sponsor_chunked_finalize.py` — offline.

The single-statement finalize_sponsor_register_import() from migration 0009
published a staged edition correctly, but as one UPDATE over every staged row.
Against the real 141,904-row edition that took ~8.5s locally and was cancelled
by Postgres (error 57014, "canceling statement due to statement timeout") on
every attempt — three times in production, same result each time, with the
edition fully staged and nothing wrong except the single statement doing all
of the work at once.

Migration 0010 replaces it with four small, idempotent RPCs — begin, promote a
chunk, withdraw a chunk, complete — each bounded to at most
SPONSOR_FINALIZE_CHUNK_SIZE rows, called repeatedly by
`app.sponsors.importer.finalize_edition` until the edition is fully published.
These checks cover that loop, its idempotency under retry, and
`resume_finalize_import` — the entry point for publishing an edition that
finished staging in a run production actually hit (id
7510ead2-962f-4b4f-a5df-87220dba0987) but never finished publishing.
