"""Regression test for "Application error: a server-side exception has
occurred" on the coach Sponsored Company detail page ("View company"):
`python test_sponsored_company_page_error_handling.py` (no pytest, no
network).

Root cause: sponsorship status, active jobs, contacts, and outreach history
are each a separate live read (getSponsorshipStatus, fetchActiveJobs,
getContacts, getOutreachActivitiesForCompany) — three of the four `throw`
on any failure (an un-migrated table, a transient network error, ...), and
none of the page's four sibling pages (Companies, Sponsored Companies list,
Outreach dashboard) leave their equivalent fetch unguarded — each wraps it
in try/catch and renders a friendly EmptyState instead. This one page did
not, so any of those four failing reached Next.js as an unhandled
exception (an opaque digest page, no message) instead of the same friendly
message its siblings would show for the identical underlying failure.

This is a static source check, not a live reproduction (no test in this
repo can start the real Next.js server or hit a real Supabase project) —
it can't confirm any specific query succeeds or fails, only that a future
edit can't silently remove the try/catch this fix added without failing
here first.
