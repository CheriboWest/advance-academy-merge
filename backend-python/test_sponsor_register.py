"""Self-check for sponsor-register ingestion: `python test_sponsor_register.py`.

Offline by design: the GOV.UK download is never exercised against the live site.
The parser runs on a fixture CSV that carries the shapes the real file has
(BOM, quoted commas, ampersands, accents, dotted abbreviations, a blank line, a
nameless row, a repeated line), and the write path runs against a fake Supabase
that enforces the `natural_key` unique index.
