"""Claude entity resolution between a crawled company and register candidates.

Claude decides only ONE thing: whether the crawled company and a supplied
register row describe the same organisation. It is never asked, and is never
able to answer, whether a company holds a sponsor licence — that comes from the
register row it selects. A resolution with no candidates is `no_match` without a
model call at all.

Guardrails that live in code rather than in the prompt, because a prompt cannot
enforce them:

  * only ids from the supplied candidate list are accepted;
  * `ambiguous` never becomes a match, whatever confidence is returned;
  * a `match` below MIN_MATCH_CONFIDENCE is downgraded to `ambiguous`;
  * a `match` with no selected candidate is downgraded to `ambiguous`.
