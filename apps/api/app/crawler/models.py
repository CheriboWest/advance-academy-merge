    """The four coach-facing metrics, derived from the internal counters.

    Single source of truth for both a live `CrawlStats` (mid-crawl / just
    finalized) and a `crawl_runs` row read back later — the two are computed
    the same way so the log line, the API response, and the frontend cards
    can never drift from each other.

    Decision (an already-existing job that gets refreshed, i.e.
    `updated_jobs`, is shown to the coach as a duplicate, not as new): from
    the coach's point of view nothing new appeared in the pipeline — the same
    posting was recognized again, whether that happened within this crawl
    (`duplicate_jobs`) or against a posting from an earlier crawl
    (`updated_jobs`). `updated_jobs` itself is NOT deleted or renamed — it
    stays a distinct internal counter (is the upsert-refresh path actually
    being exercised?) — it is simply folded into "Duplicate jobs" here.

    `jobs_verified` = `normalized_jobs + duplicate_jobs`, i.e. every raw job
    that made it far enough to be normalized and content-hashed, whether it
    then became a new job, a refresh of an existing one, or an in-crawl
    repeat. This is deliberately NOT "only inserted jobs", NOT "jobs
    currently active in the whole database", and NOT "manually reviewed" —
    it is jobs from *this* crawl that the pipeline successfully processed.
    Today every raw job reaches normalization (nothing is rejected earlier),
    so this equals `raw_jobs`; the formula is expressed in terms of
    `normalized_jobs + duplicate_jobs` rather than reusing `raw_jobs`
    directly so that a future validation step that drops malformed raw jobs
    before normalization would correctly lower `jobs_verified` below
    `raw_jobs` without any change here.
