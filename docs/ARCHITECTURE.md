# Architecture

## Product summary

Advance Academy is a career-tools web app with five AI-powered features:

1. **CV Optimizer** — analyzes a CV against a job description and returns section-by-section scores and expert feedback.
2. **Dream Company Finder** — profile in, 4-step career intelligence pipeline out (market level, company matrix, target roles, career roadmap).
3. **Outreach Generator** — generates a LinkedIn message and an email tailored to a target company, person, and intent.
4. **Interview Prep** — live mock interview with persona-driven questions, IRS scoring per answer, a final feedback report, and an evidence-grounded "enhanced answer" coach.
5. **CV Library** — persistent per-user CV store. The user uploads a CV, the system extracts every bullet, generates the 5 most important "missing details" per bullet, and the user fills them with text/file/URL evidence. The artifacts are reused by the Interview Prep coach so it stops hallucinating.

All AI features are powered by Anthropic Claude. **Persistence:** Interview Prep and the CV Library write to Supabase Postgres (sessions, assessments, coaching, CV versions, bullets, gaps, artifacts). CV Optimizer, Dream Company, and Outreach remain stateless request/response. There is no auth — Supabase rows are owned by a hardcoded `MVP_USER_ID`. See [CV_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](./CV_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) for the CV Library + coach-answer flow.

## The 4-layer request flow

Every feature request travels through the same four layers. The Dream Company "generate" flow is the canonical example:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant UI as Feature Screen<br/>features/*/components
    participant Hook as Feature Hook<br/>features/*/hooks
    participant FC as Frontend Client<br/>features/*/api/frontend-client.ts
    participant Proxy as Next.js Route<br/>app/api/*/route.ts
    participant BC as Backend Client<br/>shared/api/backend-client.ts
    participant BE as Fastify Route<br/>backend/src/routes
    participant Svc as Service<br/>backend/src/services
    participant LLM as Anthropic Claude

    User->>UI: Submit form
    UI->>Hook: generateFromProfile(profile)
    Hook->>FC: generateDreamCompanies(profile)
    FC->>Proxy: POST /api/dream-company/generate
    Proxy->>BC: generateDreamCompaniesWithBackend(payload)
    BC->>BE: POST ${BACKEND_URL}/api/dream-company/generate
    BE->>Svc: generateDreamCompanyReport(profile)
    Svc->>LLM: Anthropic SDK (4 sequential calls)
    LLM-->>Svc: JSON responses
    Svc-->>BE: DreamCompanyResult
    BE-->>BC: 200 application/json
    BC-->>Proxy: DreamCompanyResult
    Proxy-->>FC: NextResponse.json(result)
    FC-->>Hook: DreamCompanyResult
    Hook-->>UI: setResult(data)
    UI-->>User: Render result
```

Every feature — CV Optimizer, Dream Company, Outreach, Interview Prep, CV Library — follows this exact shape. **If you're adding something new, replicate it.** (Historical note: the interview-prep + evaluate routes used to bypass Fastify and call Anthropic / Supabase directly from Next.js. They have been refactored to follow this canonical flow; the corresponding `app/api/interview/*` and `app/api/evaluate/*` files are now thin proxies.)

## Why a Next.js proxy layer?

A reasonable question: why not call the Fastify backend directly from the browser?

Three reasons:

1. **`BACKEND_URL` stays server-only.** The proxy route reads it via `shared/env/server.ts`. The browser never sees or needs it, so internal URLs stay internal.
2. **Server-side validation.** Each `app/api/*/route.ts` validates the request body with a type guard before forwarding. Malformed requests are rejected at the edge and never reach Fastify.
3. **Normalized error shape.** The `HttpClientError` thrown by `shared/api/http-client.ts` is caught in every proxy route and converted into a consistent `ApiErrorResponse` (`{ code, message }`) that the frontend already knows how to handle.

As a side benefit, when you deploy Next.js to Vercel and Fastify to a separate service, the browser only needs to know about the Next.js origin — CORS stays simple and `FRONTEND_URL` only needs to match one host.

## State & persistence

The app has **two storage layers**:

- **Supabase Postgres** — backs Interview Prep and the CV Library. The backend talks to it via `backend/src/lib/supabase.ts` (`getSupabase()` for service-role access, `getUserIdFromToken()` for the auth preHandler). Tables (see `supabase/migrations/`):
  - `interview_sessions`, `interview_questions`, `answer_assessments`, `answer_coaching` — interview transcripts + IRS scores + per-answer coaching
  - `cv_versions`, `cv_bullets`, `cv_version_bullets`, `bullet_gaps`, `bullet_artifacts` — the CV Library knowledge base. `cv_bullets` is a **user-scoped pool**: bullets belong to a `user_id`, not a `cv_version_id`, and multiple CV versions reference the same bullet via the `cv_version_bullets` junction table (M:N). This is what makes a single gap/artifact visible across every CV the user uploads — see [CV_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](./CV_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) for the design rationale.
  - `cv_bullets.bullet_embedding` is a `vector(1024)` column (pgvector) populated by Voyage `voyage-3.5-lite`. Used for cross-CV similarity search during the two-phase upload flow.
  - `coach_understanding_reports` — persisted markdown reports for the "AI Coach's Understanding About My Background" feature.
  - `companies`, `job_targets`, `candidate_profiles`, etc. — supporting tables
- **In-memory `Map` (single process)** — used by **CV Optimizer** only. `POST /api/cv-optimizer/analyze` returns `202` + a `jobId`; the client polls `GET /api/cv-optimizer/jobs/:jobId`.

  ```ts
  const jobs = new Map<jobId, JobStatusResponse>()
  ```

  **Gotcha:** This is sticky to a single process. If you deploy multiple backend instances behind a load balancer, the poll can land on a different instance and return "not found". Use sticky sessions, an external store (Redis), or stay on a single instance.

- **Dream Company, Outreach** — still pure request/response. No state.
- **No user accounts. No auth.** All Supabase rows are owned by the hardcoded `MVP_USER_ID` env var (defaults to the all-zeros UUID seeded in `supabase/migrations/001_create_tables.sql`). Adding real auth means putting middleware in `backend/src/main.ts` and threading a user id through `getSupabase()` calls.

## Cross-cutting concerns

### CORS

Configured in `backend/src/main.ts:33-36`. Reads `FRONTEND_URL` from `backend/.env` and splits on commas for multiple origins:

```ts
await app.register(cors, {
  origin: frontendUrl.split(',').map((url) => url.trim()),
  credentials: true,
})
```

### Error shape

All errors — frontend, proxy, backend — conform to `ApiErrorResponse` from `@advance-academy/contracts`:

```ts
interface ApiErrorResponse {
  code: string    // e.g. 'HTTP_ERROR', 'TIMEOUT', 'INVALID_REQUEST'
  message: string
}
```

- **Frontend** — `shared/api/http-client.ts` throws `HttpClientError` carrying `status` and the parsed payload.
- **Proxy** — catches `HttpClientError` and re-emits with `NextResponse.json(error.payload, { status: error.status || 500 })`.
- **Backend** — services throw `Error` with `statusCode` or `step` properties; routes inspect those and map to the right HTTP code. See `backend/src/routes/dream-company.ts:10-65` as the canonical pattern.

### Timeouts

| Layer | Default | Set in |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend `fetchJson` | 15s | `shared/api/http-client.ts:28` |
| Frontend `fetchFormDataJson` | 120s | `shared/api/http-client.ts:83` |
| Backend client (per-feature) | 10–120s | `shared/api/backend-client.ts` |
| LLM HTTP call | 30s | `LLM_TIMEOUT_MS` env var |

Dream Company is the slowest feature (~60–120s because it runs 4 sequential LLM calls), which is why its backend-client timeout is set to 120s.

### Authentication

**None.** Every endpoint is public. Do not add auth without a product decision. If you do add it, the right place is middleware in `backend/src/main.ts` and a hook in `shared/api/backend-client.ts`.
